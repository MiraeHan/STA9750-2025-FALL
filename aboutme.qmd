Hi, I’m Mirae Han, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and graduate student at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, pursuing my M.S. in Business Analytics.

With several years of accounting experience, I’ve seen how data-driven decision-making can transform financial operations. That’s why I’m passionate about leveraging analytics to enhance accounting processes — from automating reporting and improving audit accuracy to uncovering insights that drive smarter business strategies.

By combining my accounting expertise with data analytics skills, I aim to bridge the gap between traditional finance and technology, helping organizations make more efficient, transparent, and insight-driven financial decisions.
