Hi, I’m Mirae Han, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and graduate student at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, pursuing my M.S. in Business Analytics.

I’m passionate about combining accounting expertise with data-driven thinking to uncover insights and create meaningful impact.

Outside of work and study, I enjoy yoga, photography, and exploring cafés around New York City.
